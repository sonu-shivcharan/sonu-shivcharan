# I'm Sonu Shivcharan
Frontend Web Developer | Student at Dr. D. Y. Patil Arts, Commerce & Science College, Pimpri

I am a passionate and dedicated junior frontend web developer with a strong interest in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I love to bring designs to life through code and have a keen eye for detail.

Throughout my journey as a frontend developer, I have gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on modern frameworks like React. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills.

I am a collaborative team player and thrive in environments where I can contribute my skills while learning from others. I am eager to take on new challenges and work on exciting projects that allow me to expand my knowledge and grow as a professional frontend developer.
